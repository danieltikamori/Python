# input, len and replace functions

```python
-*- coding: utf-8 -*-
len() - counts the number of characters in a given string.
input("prompt") - prompts to the user input some data.
replace("one-thing", "to-another") - replaces characters to another.
At the example below, as space is considered a character, it replaces the spaces to "nothing", so it won't be counted.
print(len((input("What is your name? ").replace(" ", ""))))
```
